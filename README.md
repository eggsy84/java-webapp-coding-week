## Welcome

On behalf of [Manchester Girl Geeks](http://manchester.girlgeekdinners.com) and 
[ResponseTap](http://manchester.girlgeekdinners.com), welcome to the Coding Picnic!

July's [Girl Geek Tea Party](http://manchester.girlgeekdinners.com) will be at our lovely sponsor 
[ResponseTap's](http://responsetap.com) offices, and as it's officially summer we'll 
be expanding the Tea Party theme to become a Coding Picnic (indoors so we don't have to worry about the weather!) with 
the choice to learn either Python or Java in our afternoon workshop. The session is suitable for complete beginners or 
those with more experience who want to develop their skills. So even if you've never done any coding before, our 
workshop will show you the basics and get you started using guides such as Codecademy. There will also be chance to 
improve your skills and see how coding can be used, with practical exercises including making a calculator, to put your 
skills to practice.

There will be ResponseTap staff on hand to guide you through the exercises and share their expertise and knowledge on 
how they use code such as Java in their work.

You'll need to bring your own laptop along, but if you don't have one please get in touch, as we may be able to 
arrange for you to borrow one.

As always, there will be plenty of tea, coffee and cake, and if you're feeling inspired to bake, why not bring along 
some of your own home-baked creations. ResponseTap are supporting Cancer Research UK, so we're encouraging donations 
to this worthy cause as you enjoy a cup of tea and a slice of cake.

## Tutorial

The remainder of this README provides instructions for the Java coding track. It will provide step by step instructions 
for getting your laptop set up and ready to go.

**1. Install Git**

[(I already have Git installed skip me to step 2)](#step2Java)

The sample starter code for the coding picnic is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/ResponseTap/mcr-girlgeeks-code-picnic)
. In order to get a copy of the sample code we need to firstly install [Git version control](https://git-scm.com).
